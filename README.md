- GuiLite samples contain 2 cross-platform projects. One is *Host Monitor* while the other is *Snake*. They are both based on [GuiLite](https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLite). They show you how to use GuiLite's interface, and how GuiLite works on iOS, Android, GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS platform.
- GuiLite samples are easy to compile & run. With the help of QQ group, you will pass the compiling nearly 100%.
