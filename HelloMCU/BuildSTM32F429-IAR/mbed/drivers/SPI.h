/** A SPI Master, used for communicating with SPI slave devices.
 *
 * The default format is set to 8-bits, mode 0, and a clock frequency of 1MHz.
 *
 * Most SPI devices will also require Chip Select and Reset signals. These
 * can be controlled using DigitalOut pins.
 *
 * @note Synchronization level: Thread safe
 *
 * Example of how to send a byte to a SPI slave and record the response:
 * @code
 * #include "mbed.h"
 *
 * SPI device(SPI_MOSI, SPI_MISO, SPI_SCLK)
 *
 * DigitalOut chip_select(SPI_CS);
 *
 * int main() {
 *     device.lock();
 *     chip_select = 0;
 *
 *     int response = device.write(0xFF);
 *
 *     chip_select = 1;
 *     device.unlock();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example using hardware Chip Select line:
 * @code
 * #include "mbed.h"
 *
 * SPI device(SPI_MOSI, SPI_MISO, SPI_SCLK, SPI_CS)
 *
 * int main() {
 *     device.lock();
 *     int response = device.write(0xFF);
 *     device.unlock();
